MSFS Weather Ballon
===================

Automates the comparison of MSFS live weather with real METARs.

Start a MSFS free flight and run the program. The program will look up a series
of METAR reports at https://aviationweather.gov.  It will teleport your plane
to the METAR location in-sim and measure as many of the METAR variables as possible.
The results are printed out in a table.
